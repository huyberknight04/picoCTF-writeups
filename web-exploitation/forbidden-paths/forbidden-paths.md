# :pencil: Description

Can you get the flag? We know that the website files live in /usr/share/nginx/html/ and the flag is at /flag.txt but the website is filtering absolute file paths. Can you get past the filter to read the flag? Here's the [website](https://play.picoctf.org/practice/challenge/270).

# :unlock: Solution

1. Access the link

    ![image1](images/image1.png)

2. According to the description, we can't use an absolute path like `/flag.txt`

    ![image2](images/image2.png)

3. So I tried using a relative path to read the contents of `/flag.txt`, like `../../../../../../../../flag.txt`

# :writing_hand: Notes

- The `relative path` is specified differently in Linux and Windows, as the two OSes use / and \ to separate directories, respectively. 
- An `absolute path` is the location of a file or directory specified from the root directory. It represents the complete path from the start of the filesystem from the root directory.
