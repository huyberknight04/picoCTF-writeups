# :unlock: Solution

1. Access the link

    ![image1](images/image1.png)

2. I received a message suggesting that I need to use `PicoBrowser` to access this website `>` Then I opened `DevTools` and started

    First, I needed to change the `User-Agent` to `PicoBrowser`

    ![image2](images/image2.png)

    I got this

    ![image3](images/image3.png)

    Second, it seems I need to access the page directly from their own website `>` Let's use the `Referer` header

    ![image4](images/image4.png)

    I got this

    ![image5](images/image5.png)

    Third, it seems I need to go back in time `>` Let's use the `Date` header

    ![image6](images/image6.png)

    I got this

    ![image7](images/image7.png)

    Fourth, it seems I need to avoid being tracked `>` Let's use the 'DNT' header

    ![image8](images/image8.png)

    I got this

    ![image9](images/image9.png)

    Fifth, it seems I need to be in Sweden `>` Let's use the `X-Forwarded-For` header and ip address from Sweden

    ![image10](images/image10.png)

    I got this

    ![image11](images/image11.png)

    Sixth, it seems I need to use the Swedish language `>` Let's use the `Accept-Language` with `sv` value

    ![image12](images/image12.png)

    And I got this

    ![image13](images/image13.png)

# :writing_hand: Notes

- The HTTP `User-Agent` request header is a characteristic string that lets servers and network peers identify the application, operating system, vendor, and/or version of the requesting user agent.
- The HTTP `Referer` request header contains the absolute or partial address from which a resource has been requested. 
- The HTTP `Date` request and response header contains the date and time at which the message originated.
- The HTTP `DNT` (Do Not Track) request header indicates the user's tracking preference. It lets users indicate whether they would prefer privacy rather than personalized content.
- The HTTP `X-Forwarded-For` (XFF) request header is a de-facto standard header for identifying the originating IP address of a client connecting to a web server through a proxy server.
- The HTTP `Accept-Language` request header indicates the natural language and locale that the client prefers.
