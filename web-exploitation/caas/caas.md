4. It seems that when I send a request, the `message` part gets passed into a program called `cowsay` `>` Since it's part of a command, we can terminate the original command and execute a new one using a `semicolon (;)` `>` So I tried it with the `ls` command

    And read the contents of the flag.txt file with the `cat` command
