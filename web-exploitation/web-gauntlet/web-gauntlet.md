# :unlock: Solution

1. Access the link

    ![image1](images/image1.png)

2. Access the `filter.php` file `>` The characters not used in each round will appear here and must be logged in with the username `admin`

    `Round 1: or` `>` I used the payload `admin' --`

    ![image2](images/image2.png)

    `Round2: or and like = --` `>` Since `--` is no longer allowed, we'll use another character that can be used to comment out SQL statements `>` I used the payload `admin'/*`

    ![image3](images/image3.png)

    `Round3: or and = like > < --` `>` I tried using the payload from the previous round and it work `>` Alternatively, we can use the payload `admin';` since `;` is a statement terminator in SQL

    ![image4](images/image4.png)

    `Round4: or and = like > < -- admin` `>` I can no longer use `admin` directly, but we can concatenate characters using `||` `>` I used the payload `a'||'dmin';`

    ![image5](images/image5.png)

    `Round5: or and = like > < -- union admin` `>` Let's use the payload from the previous round

    ![image6](images/image6.png)

    And I received a message `Congrats! You won! Check out filter.php`

3. Reload the `filter.php` page `>` I found it
