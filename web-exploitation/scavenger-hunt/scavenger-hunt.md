    And I found a hint about the second part of the flag in the `myjs.js` file

    ![image4](images/image4.png)

4. After some research, I tried accessing the `robots.txt` file `>` I found a new hint and the third part of the flag

    ![image5](images/image5.png)

5. From the hint, it seemed there might be a configuration file of the Apache server `>` The `.htaccess` file could be one of them `>` I found a new hint and the fourth part of the flag

    ![image6](images/image6.png)

6. From the hint, I tried opening the `.DS_Store` file because it's a hidden file on macOS `>` And I found the last part of the flag
