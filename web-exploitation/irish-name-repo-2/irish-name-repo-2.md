# :writing_hand: Notes

‚ÄúRegular‚Äù SQL injection is also called `in-band SQLi` because the attacker is able to receive results in the same way they performed the attack itself. A typical example would be to submit a web form with an SQLi payload and then see the returned database records on the same page.
